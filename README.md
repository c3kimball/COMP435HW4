## Radix Sort
radix sort implemented using counting sort as the main sorting algorithm.

### How to Use
When prompted, enter in how many numbers you want to be sorted, the lower bound of the numbers and then the upper bounds.
I've implemented some basic error handling, but the function expects positive integers.<br>

To quit out of the program enter the value, 0, when asked for how many numbers you want to be sorted. <br>

This program can be run in a pyhton environment or through command prompt.
